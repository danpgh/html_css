<h1>Whait, what?
<p> Wait a minnute, I said i wanted simple, but not boring.
  What is up witk this design? There's nothing on it but white
  space and some text and a minimal picture. That's not what i had in mind.
  The type is all in Helvetica, which I like, but it doesn't excite me
    at all. There is just no character to anything here. It has a minimal look,
     but it's just too vanilla. I realy need something to grab the attention of a
     visitor to the site and just doesn't do it.
